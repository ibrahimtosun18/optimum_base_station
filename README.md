# Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Simulation

This MATLAB code simulates a wireless sensor network (WSN) scenario with a base station and multiple sensor nodes. It calculates the energy consumption for both an optimal base station position, determined based on subscriber locations and energy consumption, and a fixed base station position.

## Overview

The simulation includes the following features:

- Generates random positions for sensor nodes within a network grid.
- Determines the optimal base station position based on the mean position of all nodes.
- Compares the performance of the optimal base station position with a fixed base station position.
- Visualizes network topology and energy consumption through plots.

## Usage

1. **Setting Parameters**: Modify the parameters in the code for customization.
2. **Running the Simulation**: Execute the MATLAB script.
3. **Viewing Results**: Analyze the plotted results after simulation completion.
